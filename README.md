# Text-simplification

This repository contains the code for evaluating text simplification using the Flan-T5-base model. The main objective is to assess the performance of the model in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios for various text simplification tasks, focusing on audiences who need assistive technology for reading, such as individuals with dyslexia or autism.


**Repository Structure**

flan_T5_model_dyslexia.py: Main script to run the text simplification experiments.

evaluate_results.py: Script to evaluate the generated results using SARI and BERTScore.

test_dataset.pkl: The test dataset used for evaluation.

validation_dataset.pkl: The validation dataset used for creating few-shot examples.

output_data_flan_t5_base_semantic_shots.json: Sample output JSON file generated by the model.


**Requirements**
Python 3.8 or above
PyTorch
Transformers library from Hugging Face
EASSE package for evaluation
CUDA-compatible GPU (optional for faster inference)
