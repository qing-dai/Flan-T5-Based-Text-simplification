# Text-simplification

This repository contains the code for evaluating text simplification using the Flan-T5-base model. The main objective is to assess the performance of the model in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios for various text simplification tasks, focusing on audiences who need assistive technology for reading, such as individuals with dyslexia or autism.
